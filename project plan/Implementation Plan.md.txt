Implementation Plan - Preparing for Hosting
This plan outlines the steps required to make the Vantage platform ready for production hosting. Since the application currently uses local storage for data, the focus will be on build optimization, environment configuration, and routing support for static hosting.

Proposed Changes
Configuration and Optimization
[MODIFY] 
vite.config.js
Update Vite configuration to include a base path and potential build optimizations.
Ensure the build output is clean and ready for deployment.
[NEW] 
.env.example
Provide a template for environment variables, such as VITE_API_URL (for future backend integration) and VITE_APP_TITLE.
Hosting Support
[NEW] 
vercel.json
 / 
public/_redirects
Add configuration files for common hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify) to handle Single Page Application (SPA) routing. This ensures that refreshing the page on routes like /profile doesn't result in a 404 error.
Documentation
[NEW] 
DEPLOYMENT.md
Create a comprehensive guide for the user on how to deploy the application to various platforms (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or a custom VPS).
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Run npm run build to verify the production build process completes without errors.
Check the dist directory for the existence of 
index.html
 and the assets folder.
Manual Verification
Share the deployment instructions with the user and offer to help with any specific hosting provider they choose.
