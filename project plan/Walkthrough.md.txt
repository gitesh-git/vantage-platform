Walkthrough - Hosting Preparation
I have completed the changes necessary to make the Vantage platform ready for production hosting.

Changes Made
1. Build Optimization
Updated 
vite.config.js
 to include a base path and production build settings.
Verified that npm run build (executed via node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build due to local environment restrictions) successfully creates a dist/ folder.
2. Single Page Application (SPA) Routing
Added 
vercel.json
 to handle routing on Vercel.
Added 
public/_redirects
 for Netlify support.
This prevents 404 errors when users refresh the page on routes like /profile.
3. Environment Configuration
Created 
.env.example
 to help you manage environment variables in different environments.
4. Documentation
Created 
DEPLOYMENT.md
 with step-by-step instructions for Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, and custom VPS hosting.
Verification Results
Build Process: Successfully generated production assets in the dist/ directory.
Routing Configuration: Configuration files for Vercel and Netlify are correctly placed to manage SPA routes.
Local Execution: The app is running at http://localhost:5173/.

Next Steps
Review the

 file.
Choose a hosting provider (I recommend Vercel or Netlify for this project).
Follow the instructions to go live!
